OpenClimateGIS
==============

OpenClimateGIS is a Python-based web server that distributes climate model data
in geospatial (vector) formats.

* PostGIS_ - adds geospatial functionality to PostgreSQL databases
* psycopg2_ - a Python interface for working with PostgreSQL databases
* numpy_ - a multi-dimensionsal data library for Python
* netcdf4-python_ - a Python interface for working with netCDF4 files
* pyKML_ - a library for manipulating KML documents

Installation
------------

The following instructions for installing OpenClimateGIS on Ubuntu 10.04 
running on Amazon's `Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)`_, a component of 
`Amazon Web Services (AWS)`_.

.. _Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
.. _Amazon Web Services (AWS): http://aws.amazon.com/

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating an AWS Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although it is not required, installing OpenClimateGIS on an AWS has the 
benefits having an isolated instance with specific library versions. 
Deploying on AWS also allows for the ability to scale to multiple servers 
in the future.

An EC2 instance can be created from within Python, using boto_, a Python 
interface to Amazon Web Services.  The following is an example script that
creates an EC2 instance and returns the Public DNS.
Note that this assumes that you have set the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and 
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables as described in the boto 
documentation.::

    from time import sleep
    from boto.ec2.connection import EC2Connection
    conn = EC2Connection()

    # start an instance of Ubuntu 10.04
    ami_ubuntu10_04 = conn.get_all_images(image_ids=['ami-3202f25b'])
    reservation = ami_ubuntu10_04[0].run( \
        key_name='ec2-keypair', \
        security_groups=['OCG_group'], \
        instance_type='m1.large', \
    )
    instance = reservation.instances[0]
    sleep(1)
    while instance.state!=u'running':
        print("Instance state = {0}".format(instance.state))
        instance.update()
        sleep(10)

    print "Instance state = {0}".format(instance.state)

    # add a tag to name the instance
    instance.add_tag('Name','OpenClimateGIS')

    print "DNS="
    print instance.dns_name
    exit()

Once you configured the Security Group for the instance to allow access on 
port 22 and created an public/private key pair (See: `AWS Security Credentials`_)
you can connect to the instance using ssh::

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws_openclimategis/ec2-keypair.pem ubuntu@DNSNAME

.. _boto: http://code.google.com/p/boto/
.. _AWS Security Credentials: https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key

Installing OpenClimateGIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dependencies for OpenClimateGIS are installed via a series of bash scripts.
The main install script (INSTALL.sh) calls numerous other scripts found in the
install_scripts directory.  To download (clone) the respository, including the
install script::
    
    # download the installation script
    sudo apt-get install curl
    curl -O https://raw.github.com/tylere/OpenClimateGIS/master/INSTALL.sh
    
    # run the installation script
    chmod u+x INSTALL.sh
    . INSTALL.sh >& ~/log_install.log

The OpenClimateGIS Django project requires a settings file (which includes
database passwords) in order to operate.  This file should be placed at
/etc/openclimategis/settings.ini

    sudo mkdir /etc/openclimategis

You can copy over the settings file that you use for development to your AWS 
server using the secure copy command (executed on your development machine)::

    sudo scp -i ~/.ssh/aws_openclimategis/ec2-keypair.pem /etc/openclimategis/settings.ini ubuntu@PUBLICDNS:

The scp copy places the file in the ubuntu user's home directory.  Move the 
file to its destination using::

    sudo mv ~/settings.ini /etc/openclimategis/settings.ini

Javascript Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API Query Builder uses the ExtJS framework, the Google Maps API, and Wicket
to provide a user-friendly interface for constructing OpenClimateGIS queries. It
requires that ExtJS 4.x media files are installed and accessible. Currently, the
API Query Builder uses ExtJS 4.0.7 and version 3.7 of the Google Maps API. The
Google Maps API is loaded automatically with the Query Builder.

Download ExtJS: http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download

ExtJS 4.0.7 should be extracted into the following directory off of localhost
(or whatever the host name is):

    localhost/static/extjs/4.0.7/

Resources should be accessible at the following locations, again using localhost
as an example:

    localhost/static/extjs/4.0.7/resources/css/ext-all-gray.css
    localhost/static/extjs/4.0.7/ext-debug.js

Fabric can also be used to install the ExtJS resources on AWS:

    fab apache2.make_local_copy_of_extjs

Download Wicket: http://github.com/arthur-e/Wicket

    git clone git@github.com:arthur-e/Wicket.git

The Wicket library (for WKT transforms) should be made accessible from:

    localhost/static/Wicket/
